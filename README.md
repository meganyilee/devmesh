# DevMesh Projects

## Projects
- Tweet Classify
- ? Fashion App

## Tweet Classify Project:

### Requirements:
- node.js
- react.js
- flask
- openvino 2019 r1.1
- raspberry pi 3 b+
- intel ncs 2
- tweet search api

### Workflow:
1. Access react web app
2. Upload photo
3. Get classification from Classify API
4. Use classification from API to get related tweet
5. Repeat step 1-4 if needed :)

### Process:
Classify API will be a custom REST API hosted on the Raspberry Pi. Raspberry Pi will be the channel through which images are processed and predictions will be sent from raspberry pi to client via http response. Images will be sent to Raspberry Pi via POST request from client react app.


### Purpose:
- Replicable demo for users to try out themselves
- Learn/Observe example of Full Stack Development
- Learn how to integrate OpenVINO + NCS 2 samples/demos in stack at low cost development
- Having Fun!


## ? Fashion App

### Requirements:

### Workflow:

### Process:

------------------

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
